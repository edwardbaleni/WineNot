ABSTRACT = {High-quality wines in industrial winemaking frequently require a professional winemaker to make adjustments according to the wine of single-batch fermentation. Blending can improve the chemical composition and certain organoleptic properties of wine, promote copigmentation, and increase the complexity of the wine body and aroma. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS/MS) were used to study the effects of adding 20% of Merlot, Marselan, Syrah and Pinot Noir and different blending methods on the nutritional, taste, color and aroma components of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The results showed that the highest total phenols and flavonoids, the greatest content of antioxidant characteristics, the optimal color according to the parameter of T, red% and blue% and the most abundant aroma were observed both in CGM (grape blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) and CGS (grape blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Marselan), thus indicating the higher quality and complexity of these wines. In addition, the co-grapes treatment afforded more color and hue value than co-wines, which indicates co-grapes had more stable and more varied colors than co-wines. Our findings provide theoretical support for improving wine quality and craftsmanship.},
